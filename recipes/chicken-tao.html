    <h1>General Tao Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/tao.jpeg" />
    <p>
      This General Tao chicken tastes the same as the one served in Chinese
      restaurants, without the deep frying. Serve on steamed jasmine or basmati
      rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size
        pieces
      </li>
      <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped green onion</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup oyster sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Coat chicken pieces with cornstarch in a bowl; set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Beat eggs, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl until combined. Stir in flour
      and baking powder until no large lumps remain. Mix in chicken pieces until
      evenly coated.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook chicken
      in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink on the inside, about 12
      minutes. Set chicken aside; keep warm.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Make sauce: Reduce heat to medium-high; add green onion, ginger, and
      sesame oil to the skillet. Cook and stir until onion is limp and ginger
      begins to brown, about 1 minute. Pour in water, sugar, and vinegar; bring
      to a boil.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
      Dissolve cornstarch in soy sauce in a small bowl and stir into vinegar
      mixture along with oyster sauce and ketchup. Cook until sauce has
      thickened and is no longer cloudy. Stir in chicken; simmer until heated
      through.
