# odin-recipes

This recipe project is to practise and show the _html knowledge_ that I learned in the foundation section of the odin project. Although the project is very simple it ensures that my basic knowledge and understanding is intact. Please note that there is no styling for a reason as this project is purely to show my _html_ skills.
